Usage
Fetching Attraction Data: When the page loads, JavaScript fetches attraction data from a local JSON DB server (http://localhost:3000/attractions). The data is processed to ensure it's an array, and missing properties like likes, reviews, and inquiries are initialized.

Creating Attraction Cards: The createAttractionCard function is responsible for generating attraction cards and adding them to the gallery. For each attraction, an HTML card element is created with an image, name, description, like button, likes count, review section, and inquiry section.

Liking Attractions: Users can click the "Like" button to increment the number of likes for an attraction. The updateLikesCount function updates the displayed likes count when the button is clicked.

## Enabling Persistence for Likes Count

In this project, we've implemented a feature that enables persistence of likes count for attractions and reflects the changes on the JSON server using a PATCH request. This allows the likes count to be updated and stored on the server, ensuring that the data remains consistent even after page reloads.

### How it Works

When a user clicks the "Like" button for an attraction, the likes count is incremented locally in the browser using JavaScript. However, to ensure that the likes count is also updated on the server and persisted between sessions, we've implemented the following steps:

1. **PATCH Request to JSON Server**: We've added a PATCH request to update the likes count for a specific attraction on the JSON server. This request is triggered when the "Like" button is clicked and sends the updated likes count to the server.

2. **JavaScript Implementation**: In the JavaScript code, the `updateAttractionLikes` function sends a PATCH request to the server, updating the likes count for the corresponding attraction. Here's how the function looks:

   ```javascript
   function updateAttractionLikes(attractionId, likes) {
     fetch(`http://localhost:3000/attractions/${attractionId}`, {
       method: "PATCH",
       headers: {
         "Content-Type": "application/json",
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({ likes }),
     });
   }

   // ...

   // Inside the "Like" button event listener
   likeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
     attraction.likes++; // Increment the likes when the button is clicked
     updateLikesCount(card, attraction.likes);
     updateAttractionLikes(attraction.id, attraction.likes); // Update likes on the server
     saveAttractions(attractions); // Save updated data to localStorage
   });
   ```

Leaving Reviews: When a user adds a review or asks a question, the app updates the local data, sends a PATCH request to the server to update the attraction data, and saves the updated data to localStorage

Asking Inquiries: Users can ask questions about attractions by typing a question in the inquiry input field and clicking the "Ask" button. The updateInquiryList function adds the new inquiry to the inquiry list.

Contact Us Page: Users can navigate to the "Contact Us" page to get in touch via email (info@tembeakenya.com) for more information or inquiries.
